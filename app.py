            Mix the dry ingredients together and then push them to the sides, so there is a little well in the middle.
            Add 2 tbsp boiling oil to the well. Mix in the oil with the dry ingredients.
            Slowly add 3/4 -1 cup water and mix in. Keep adding water and mixing until you get a smooth batter with no lumps and a runny consistency.

            Stuff the Mirchi
            - Slit the mirchi/ menshinkai down the middle, just 3/4 of the way down. It should still be connected on one side.
            Combine 1 tsp jeera powder with 1/4 tsp salt in a small bowl.
            Stuff the mirchi/ menshinkai evenly with this mixture. (Note: you could also add ginger, garlic, and or finely chopped onions.)
            Fry the Mirchi
            - Fill a frying pan about half full with oil. Heat at a medium flame.
            Dip the stuffed mirchi/ menshinkai in the batter. Coat completely with a thick, even layer of batter.
            Slowly drop a coated Mirchi into the frying pan. (Note: Make sure that there is enough oil to completely cover the Mirchi. Place as many Mirchi as you can in the oil, but spread them apart â€“ donâ€™t let them touch each other.)
            Deep fry all the Mirchi in batches until they turn golden and crispy. When you take them out of the oil, place them on a paper towel  (placed on a bowl or plate) to absorb the oil. Enjoy hot! ðŸ™‚
